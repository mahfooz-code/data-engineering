#   Data modeling and design
    To derive business insights from data, through business analytics and data science, the data must be in a usable form
    The process for converting data into a usable form is known as data modeling and design.
    Where we traditionally think of data modeling as a problem for DBAs and ETL developers, data modeling can happen almost anywhere in an organization.
    Firmware engineers develop the data format of a record for an IoT device, or web application developers design the JSON response to an API call or a MySQL table schema -- these are all instances of data modeling and design.
