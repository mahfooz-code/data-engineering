#   Data lineage
    As data moves through its lifecycle, how do you know what system affected the data, or what the data is comprised of as it gets passed around and transformed?

    Data lineage describes the recording of an audit trail of data through its lifecycle, tracking both the systems that process the data, as well as what data it depends upon.

    Data lineage helps with error tracking, accountability, and debugging of both data and the systems that process it.

    It has the obvious benefit of giving an audit trail for the data lifecycle, but also helps with compliance.
    For example, if a user would like their data deleted from your systems, having the data lineage of that user’s data allows you to know where that data is stored and its dependencies.

    A data engineer should be aware of data lineage, as it’s becoming a key piece both for debugging data workflows, as well as tracing data that may need to be removed wherever it resides.
