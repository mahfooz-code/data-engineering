#   Lakehouse

    The Lakehouse architecture, as depicted in the following diagram, merges the low-cost storage of a data lake with the massively parallel processing (MPP) power of a warehouse to serve the diverse and ever-evolving requirements of modern-era analytics:

    Here are a few important features of the Lakehouse architecture:

#   Supports low-cost storage

    The Lakehouse architecture carries forward the support for using low-cost storage. Data can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured over open formats such as Parquet.

#   Supports ACID transactions
    
    An absence of transaction support hugely impacts the data integrity and quality in a data lake.
    
    Over the years, dealing with duplicated and deleted data has been a huge challenge. In the early days, I remember going through a multi-step process in Hive to deal with this. 
    A few years later, Spark took over, but the challenge stayed the same.
    But the struggle is finally over. long live Databricks Delta Lake!


#   Metadata management

    The Lakehouse architecture offers strong metadata management features such as schema enforcement and evolution. Once again, the absence of such features in the past has forced us to perform similar checks using code.

#   Segregation of storage and compute
    The Lakehouse architecture preserves the idea of decoupling storage and compute for massive scalability and cost-saving.

#   Support for BI tools
    Lakehouse architecture supports connectivity to all major BI tools using standard Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)/Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) connectivity.

#   Native support for Structured Query Language (SQL) 
    
    Users can easily utilize the power of the SQL language for performing analytics.

#   Supports streaming workloads
    
    The Lakehouse architecture supports real-time analytics and reporting using streaming data.

#   Vendors
    In Azure, the Lakehouse architecture is implemented using Synapse Analytics.
