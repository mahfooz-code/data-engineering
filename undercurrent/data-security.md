#   Data security

    Data lakes can comply with the core requirements of most compliance frameworks using the following techniques to cover the key pillars of the CIA triad:

    ****Perimeter security****
    
    Access to data lake resources can be limited using a combination of site-to-site virtual private networks (VPNs), filtering Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and blocking access to the internet.

    ****Access control****
    
    User access in a data lake can be controlled by a combination of role-based access control (RBAC), policies, access control lists (ACLs), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and single-sign-on (SSO).
    
    ****Encryption****
    A key method of protecting data-in-motion (traveling from one point to another) and data-at-rest (in storage) is using encryption. Encryption can be implemented not only at the file level in the storage, but also any personally identifiable information (PII) data within a file can be encrypted.
    
    ****Authorization****
    
    Extreme caution is desired during data distribution. The task becomes even more complex if data distribution includes external users. A data lake can comply with authorization needs by implementing a role-based access mechanism (RBAC) using a combination of table-, row-, and column-based security and data masking.

    For any organization that deals with data, security is no longer a luxuryâ€”it is a core requirement.
